    "Graph theory and in particular the graph ADT (abstract data-type) is widely explored and implemented in the field of Computer Science and Mathematics. Consisting of vertices (nodes) and the edges (optionally directed/weighted) that connect them, the data-structure is effectively able to represent and solve many problem domains. One of the most popular areas of algorithm design within this space is the problem of checking for the existence or (shortest) path between two or more vertices in the graph. Properties such as edge weighting and direction are two such factors that the algorithm designer can take into consideration. In this post I will be exploring two of the simpler available algorithms, Depth-First and Breath-First search to achieve the goals highlighted below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find all vertices in a subject vertices connected component.\n",
    "- Return all available paths between two vertices.\n",
    "- And in the case of BFS, return the shortest path (length measured by number of path edges).\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "So as to clearly discuss each algorithm I have crafted a connected graph with six vertices and six incident edges. The resulting graph is undirected with no assigned edge weightings, as length will be evaluated based on the number of path edges traversed. There are two popular options for representing a graph, the first being an adjacency matrix (effective with dense graphs) and second an adjacency list (effective with sparse graphs). I have opted to implement an adjacency list which stores each node in a dictionary along with a set containing their adjacent nodes. As the graph is undirected each edge is stored in both incident nodes adjacent sets.\n",
